==--------------------------------= Setup =--------------------------------==

- On your terrain, add the component "EDEN Terrain Painter".
- Either create your own texture profile from "Create/EDEN/New Texture Data" or use one of the pre-created profiles included in the package.
- You will need to install the Unity Mathematics package from the package manager. 

==-----------------------------= Properties =-----------------------------==

Painter Script:

 - Affects Neighbor Terrains - When enabled the effects will also carry over to neighbor terrains.
 - Auto Update - I'm sure you can figure out what this does.

Texture Profile:

 - Base Layer - The main texture applied on the terrain. All other textures will be applied on top of this.
 - Terrain Layers - The array of textures that use rule based painting. These will be applied in the order of the array.
 
Terrain Layers:
 - Layer - The terrain layer
 - Smoothness - Blurriness/Smoothness of the terrain layer.

 - Min Angle - The minimum angle (degrees) that the texture will appear on.
 - Max Angle - The maximum angle (degrees) that the texture will appear on.
 - Invert Angle Mask - Hmmmmmmmm, I wonder what this could do.

 - Height Range - The height range that the texture will appear in.
 - Invert Height Mask - .....

 - Roughness Threshold - The threshold of roughness that the texture will appear above.
 - Invert Roughness Mask - Come on, you don't need me to explain what this does.

 - Noise Scale - Frequency (tiling) of the noise applied to the texture.
 - Noise Magnitude - Strength of the noise applied to the texture.
