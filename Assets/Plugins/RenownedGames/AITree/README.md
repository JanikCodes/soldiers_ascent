## AITree

AI Tree features a unique decorator and service system that allows you to create more complex graphs without losing functionality. For example, creating an interesting NPC using a standard graph system can require up to 30 nodes, while AI Tree allows you to achieve the better result with just 5 nodes. This saves time and simplifies the AI creation process.

- NO DLL's: All code are written in C# and open for modifications.
- Official detailed youtube lessons: YouTube
- Detailed documentation: Documentation
- Active real-time support: Discord

One of the main advantages of AI Tree is the powerful perception and environment query systems. These systems enable you to create incredibly lifelike AI behavior that adapts to changing environments and interacts with other objects in the game world.

AI Tree provides a convenient and intuitive interface for creating AI using nodes. This tool will help you quickly create complex behaviors and reactions for your characters, as well as configure them for different scenarios.
